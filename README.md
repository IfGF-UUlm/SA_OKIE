# SURGE-Ahead observational and AI development study
This GitHub repository contains the analysis and supporting materials for the prospective observational cohort study examining the appropriateness of discharge destinations for geriatric surgical inpatients within the Supporting SURgery with GEriatric Co-Management and AI (SURGE-Ahead) project.

## Project Overview
### Background
This study, part of the SURGE-Ahead project, investigates discrepancies between standard of care discharge decisions and expert geriatrician recommendations for surgical inpatients aged 70+. It identifies key factors influencing discharge decisions and associated outcomes.

### Key Findings
- 27% Incongruence between standard of care and expert recommendations for discharge destinations.
- Incongruent discharge decisions linked to increased frailty, dependence in ADLs, reduced mobility, higher readmission rates at 3-month follow-up, and decline in functional status (Barthel Index and Charit√© Mobility Index scores).
